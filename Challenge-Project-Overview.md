## 🎯 The Challenge

### Project Summary
In this project, you will use publicly available AI research data (e.g., arXiv papers and metadata) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques with large language models to build an agent that retrieves relevant research, summarizes key findings, and translates them into business-relevant insights. This will help our organization address the challenge of efficiently monitoring and operationalizing the rapidly growing volume of AI research. Abhinav Raghunathan will serve as the KPMG business owner for the project, responsible for guiding business relevance, success criteria, and stakeholder feedback.

### Success Criteria

_Success will be measured based on:_
- Retrieval relevance: Ability to return appropriate research papers for a given query
- Summary quality: Accuracy and clarity of synthesized research insights
- Business usefulness: Extent to which outputs translate technical content into actionable business implications
- Human evaluation: Validation by KPMG stakeholders reviewing relevance and accuracy of outputs

_Human-in-the-loop checkpoint:_ 
- KPMG stakeholders will review retrieved sources, summaries, and business implications before outputs are used for internal decision-making, thought leadership, or client-facing discussions.

_A successful outcome will be:_
- A working prototype that enables natural-language querying of AI research and produces summarized, business-relevant outputs with citations
- Documented evaluation approach and results
- Demonstrated applicability for internal enablement and client conversations
- A final solution package that includes prototype documentation, evaluation results, scope limitations, and a final presentation suitable for stakeholder review.

### Stretch Goals

Potential stretch goals may include:   
- Add draft newsletter or report-generation capability for human review (e.g., research briefs or POV drafts, not publication-ready outputs)
- Introduce multi-source synthesis across research repositories
- Implement relevance ranking or personalization based on user intent
- Develop a simple front-end interface for stakeholder interaction
- Incorporate evaluation benchmarking dataset for improved retrieval accuracy

Stretch goals to be maintained within prototype scope; exclude production deployment, foundation-model fine-tuning, autonomous multi-agent orchestration, and use of PII, regulated, internal, or client data.

### Project Milestones

Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a **GitHub Projects board** to track tasks within each milestone.

| Month | Milestone | Key Activities |
|---|---|---|
| September | Foundation & Baseline RAG Development | • Data exploration and preprocessing<br>• Define evaluation framework and benchmark queries<br>• Develop baseline retrieval pipeline (RAG setup) |
| October | Pipeline Development & Evaluation | • Implement retrieval + summarization pipeline<br>• Develop prompt engineering approach for business translation<br>• Begin evaluation (relevance and accuracy testing) |
| November | Solution Refinement, User Experience & Final Delivery | • Refine model outputs and improve ranking/relevance<br>• Build lightweight user interface or interaction layer<br>• Document solution and prepare final presentation |

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.

## 📊 Dataset

**Name and Source:** Publicly available AI research data from arXiv   
**Format:** Categorical and Text, primarily in PDF format  
**Size:** under 1gb  
**Location:** arXiv Artificial Intelligence Research: https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent

### Key Details
arXiv (pronounced "archive") is a free online platform and open-access archive. Researchers use it to share early versions of scientific papers—called preprints—before formal peer review. It covers physics, mathematics, computer science, statistics, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, and economics.

## 🛠️ Suggested Approach

**ML Problem Type:** NLP / Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — research paper Q&A and business-insight summarization

**Recommended Tools & Libraries:**

| Category | Python Options |
|---|---|
| PDF Parsing | `pypdf` (or `unstructured` for more robust parsing) |
| Embeddings | `sentence-transformers` (compare multiple models) |
| Vector Store | `ChromaDB` (simpler API) or `FAISS` (more control over indexing)  |
| Pipeline / Orchestration | `LangChain` or `LlamaIndex` |
| Retrieval Enhancement *(optional)*| Cross-encoder reranker (`sentence-transformers`) |
| LLM / Generation | Free-tier LLM API (Google Gemini API, Hugging Face Inference API) |
| Evaluation Framework *(optional)* | `RAGAS` |
| Environment | Google Colab |

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Retrieval Relevance — manual check (yes/no per benchmark query), or Recall@k / Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) for a quantitative measure
- Summary Accuracy & Clarity — team rubric (1–5), or RAGAS Faithfulness / Answer Relevancy scores for automated scoring
- Business Usefulness — team rubric (1–5), paired with whichever metrics above you use
